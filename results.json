This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents.

Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed.

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",

This notice is being served as required by that rule.\n \nNYSCEF is designed for the electronic filing of documents with the court and for the electronic service of those documents, court documents, and court notices upon counsel and unrepresented litigants who have consented to electronic filing.\n \nElectronic filing offers significant benefits for attorneys and litigants, permitting papers to be filed with the court and served on other parties simply, conveniently, and quickly. NYSCEF case documents are filed with the court by filing on the NYSCEF Website, which can be done at any time of the day or night on any day of the week. The documents are served automatically on all consenting e-filers as soon as the document is uploaded to the website, which sends out an immediate email notification of the filing.\n \nThe NYSCEF System charges no fees for filing, serving, or viewing the electronic case record, nor does it charge any fees to print any filed documents. Normal filing fees must be paid, but this can be done on-line.\n \n1) Parties represented by an attorney: An attorney representing a party who is served with this Notice must promptly either consent or decline consent to electronic filing and service through NYSCEF for this case. Attorneys registered with NYSCEF may record their consent electronically in the manner provided at the NYSCEF site. Attorneys not registered with NYSCEF but intending to participate in e-filing must first create a NYSCEF account and obtain a user ID and password prior to recording their consent by going to www.nycourts.gov/efile. Attorneys declining to consent must file with the court and serve on all parties of record a declination of consent.\n \n2) Parties not represented by an attorney: Unrepresented litigants are exempt from e-filing. They can serve and file all documents in paper form and must be served with documents in paper form. However, an unrepresented litigant may consent to participate in e-filing.\n \nFor information on how to participate in e-filing, unrepresented litigants should contact the appropriate clerk in the court where the proceeding was filed or visit www.nycourts.gov/efile-unrepresented. Unrepresented litigants also are encouraged to visit www.nycourthelp.gov or contact the Help Center in the court where the proceeding was filed. An unrepresented litigant who consents to e-filing may cease participation at any time. However, the other parties may continue to e-file their court documents in the proceeding.\n\nFor additional information about electronic filing and to create a NYSCEF account, visit the NYSCEF website at www.nycourts.gov/efile or contact the NYSCEF Resource Center (phone: 646-386-3033; e-mail: efile@nycourts.gov).\nApril 13, 20, 27, May 4 2025\nLNYS0275063",
